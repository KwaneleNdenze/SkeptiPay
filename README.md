## Getting Started
### Installation Prerequisites
#### Ruby
1. Note: MacOS ships with a version of Ruby, needed for various operating systems. To avoid causing an issue with your operating system you should use a version manager for Ruby. <br /><br />If you don't already have a Ruby version manager, we highly recommend rbenv. This will allow you to have different versions running on a per project basis. The MacOS system version of Ruby will stay intact while giving you the ability to use the version needed for this Forem project. Please follow their [installation guide](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installations).
2. With the Ruby version manager, install the Ruby version listed on our badge. (i.e. with ```rbenv: rbenv install $(cat .ruby-version)```)
